# Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting


### Assignment: 
Implementing the Gaussian elimination algorithm with partial 
pivoting together with backward substitution to solve Ax = b, where A is an nxn square matrix.
The program must read A and b from two input files and output the solution x as a text file.


The program prints these values in the terminal:

- condition number for 1 and infinity if matrix is 2x2 dimension
- determinant of matrix
- X values

### Compile the code

> g++ main.cpp -o run

###  Run the program

> ./run A1.txt b1.txt
